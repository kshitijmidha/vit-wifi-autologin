# Security Information

## Windows Security Warnings

When running the setup or the application, you may encounter Windows Security warnings. This is normal because:

1. The scripts are not digitally signed (this would require a paid certificate)
2. The application needs administrative privileges to:
   - Create a folder in C: drive
   - Add itself to Windows startup
   - Monitor and manage WiFi connections

## Is it safe?

âœ… **Yes, the application is safe.** Here's why:

- All code is open source and available for inspection
- No data is collected or transmitted except for VIT login credentials
- Credentials are stored locally on your PC only
- The code only interacts with VIT's login portal
- You can review all files in the GitHub repository

## To safely run the application:

1. When you see "Windows protected your PC":

   - Click "More info"
   - Click "Run anyway"

2. When you see "User Account Control":
   - Click "Yes" to allow the program to run

## For extra security:

1. Review the source code on GitHub before installing
2. Check the installation files in `C:\VIT_WiFi_AutoLogin\`
3. Monitor the log file at `C:\VIT_WiFi_AutoLogin\wifi_login.txt`
4. Use Windows Task Manager to verify `pythonw.exe` is running

## Still concerned?

1. The application can be easily uninstalled:
   - Delete the `C:\VIT_WiFi_AutoLogin` folder
   - Remove `auto_login.vbs` from Windows startup folder
   - No other system changes are made
